### Inspecting the `bloat.flag.py` file, the majority of the file is obfuscated. The variables and functions are given simple names with seemingly random numbers, and the strings are all formed from individual concatenated characters from the string `a` which contains every character to be used.

### The first step was to attempt to run the program. Running the program results in the output:
> Please enter correct password for flag:
### It seems the program requires a specific password.

### The next step is to clean the strings to attempt to understand the program. This is done using the `cleanStrings.py` file, which prints all the necessary strings.

### After understanding the strings, the functions and variables can be made sense of. The password can be decoded as 'happychance'. The program can be rerun with the correct password to get flag.
